write a math funciton file
Add unique math funcitons
Creat a test file for unit tests
import math funciton into new test file
define funcion for each math function in math function file
use assert to operate math funciton 
Compare result
Go to terminal and in relevant directory
pytest test_math_func.py -v (for result in verbose)
py.test -v (is an alternative method to run unit test file fron termainal)
py.test -v -k "add" -> will run test with add as key word
py.test -v -k "add or string" -> will run test with add or string as key word
py.test -v -k "add and " -> will run test with add and sting as key words
py.test -v -k "add" -> will run test with add as key word
py.test -v -m number -> will run test with numbers as marker
pytest -v -x -> test exit when first failure occurs
pytest -v -x --tb = no -> test exit when first failure occurs without providgin trace
pytest -v -x -maxfail=2 -> test runs till max failure of 2
